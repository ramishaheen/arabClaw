🦾 ArabClaw — Intelligent Swarm Agent System  https://arabclaw.quantum-minds.tech/

ArabClaw is the first open-source project for Swarm Intelligence Agents that power and “beat” the ClawBot — an autonomous intelligent agent platform built with distributed AI decision-making.

A new class of intelligent agents that collaborate, learn, and act like a swarm to tackle complex tasks autonomously and efficiently.

🚀 Features

🧠 Swarm Intelligence Agents that work together cooperatively

🤖 Modular design for distributed decision-making

⚡ Built with TypeScript and scalable for real-time systems

📌 Designed to power an autonomous ClawBot-like AI ecosystem

🧩 Why ArabClaw?

ArabClaw isn’t just another bot — it’s a step toward agent-based reasoning inspired by collective intelligence. Each agent in the system can:

✔ Share insights with the swarm
✔ Make autonomous task decisions
✔ Coordinate actions with other agents

ArabClaw aims to pioneer a new generation of collaborative AI systems.

📦 Installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ramishaheen/arabClaw.git
cd arabClaw


Install dependencies

npm install


Run the project

npm start

⚙️ How It Works

ArabClaw implements a system of cooperative agents that communicate internally and act based on combined feedback loops. Key mechanisms include:

Event broadcasting

Consensus-based decision logic

Scalable asynchronous coordination

ArabClaw is structured to support additional modules and real-world agent behaviors.
